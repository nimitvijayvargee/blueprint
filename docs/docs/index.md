# Welcome to Blueprint

Blueprint is a You Ship, We Ship program open to all teenagers 13-18 (inclusive) where you build cool hardware projects (or learn how to) and get funding to make them real!

![Blueprint banner](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/72b79bc96a159671eb566cbcbd895f7679a073ac_blueprint-header.png)

## Here's the quick rundown

1. Design a custom hardware project (or build off of one of our [guides](/guides))
2. Log your design process in a journal on Blueprint
3. Apply for a grant up to $400 to buy the parts you need
4. Build your project and log your build time
5. Earn tickets based on your build time
6. Redeem tickets for tools in the [toolbag](/toolbag) that you can use in your next project

_Alternatively, if you don't need a grant, you can earn extra tickets for the [toolbag](/toolbag) by logging your project._

## What can I build?

Anything! From as simple as a 3D print, to full robots with PCBs. You can create new designs, or build off of existing creations. Work in groups if you want. We really want to see what you can cook up!
See the [submission guidelines](/docs/submission-guidelines) for more details on what we expect from your project.  
If you need inspiration, check out what other hackers have built on our [explore page](/explore) or check out our [guides](/guides) for some tutorials.

## How much money can I get?

You can apply up to $400 per project. The amount you can get depends on the complexity of your project and how much effort you put into it. If you're building off of an existing creation, we only count the parts you added.  
You want to keep your projects original and your journal highly detailed. Don't be afraid to write everything down, it's good practice for engineering!  
We split grants into tiers, each tier has a:

- Maximum cost <span class="text-bp-warning">which is not your goal</span> – you want to [reduce cost](/docs/about-cost) as much as possible
- Maximum amount of tickets you can earn for [toolbag](/toolbag) prizes.
- Estimate of how many hours it would take to reach this level of effort

> <span class="text-bp-warning">The hour amounts are not hard requirements, they are just estimates of time needed for the average hacker to achieve the quality required.</span>

#### Tier 5: up to $25 and 0.8x ticket multiplier (5-8 hours)

A super basic project which introduces you to hardware
- A 3d-printed phone stand
- A Hackercard (This needs custom art to be approved)
- A 3d printed trinket

#### Tier 4: up to $50 and a 1.0x ticket multiplier (8-16 hours)

A basic project that doesn’t require much time. This is a project that is cool but not very unique.

Examples include:

- A drone (that doesn't have many custom parts)
- A custom ubikey
- A custom LED lamp
- A custom keyboard/macropad

#### Tier 3: up to $100 and a 1.1x ticket multiplier (17-33 hours)

An intermediate custom project that has a bit more of that “flare”.

Examples include:

- A full **split** keyboard (see guides)
- A MIDI (see guides)
- A custom game console
- A custom RP2040 devoard (see guides)

#### Tier 2: up to $200 and a 1.25x ticket multiplier (34-66 hours)

A fairly advanced project that you are very proud of.

Examples include:

- A Fairy weight battle Bot
- A custom robot arm
- A custom FPGA board

#### Tier 1: up to $400 and a 1.5x ticket multiplier (67-131+ hours)

A super advanced project that would be the cornerstone of your portfolio.

Examples include:

- A 3d Printer
- A CNC mill/router
- A custom robot dog
- A custom FPGA board

<span class="text-bp-warning">A tier's maximum cost is not a goal, you want to [reduce cost](/docs/about-cost) as much as possible!</span>

## What are tickets? How do I earn them?

Tickets reward you for the effort spent on building the project.

<span class="text-bp-warning">You get 10 tickets per hour of building.</span>

Your building time must be accurately logged in your journal. And we may adjust your ticket amount based on the quality of your final build.

You can spend tickets in the [toolbag](/toolbag) to get tools and parts for your next project. The more tickets you have, the better stuff you can get.

## How do I get started?

We've made it super easy to get started, it takes less than 5 minutes to start journaling.

1. If you haven't already, [create an account](/auth/login) on Blueprint!
2. Follow the tasks listed on your [home page](/) to set up your account and get started!
3. Check the [faq](/faq) if you have any questions.
4. Ask for help in [#blueprint-support](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C09CMJV6V6K) on the Hack Club Slack if you have more questions!

We're excited to see what build!
